#Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
#c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
#Exercise 2: What is a program?
#A program is a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something
#Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
#interperter:
#-reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer
#-parses the source code
#-interprets the instructions on the fly
#compiler:
#-needs to be handed the entire program in a file
#-it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language
#-puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution
#Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?
#a) The Python interpreter
#Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:
#>>> primt 'Hello world!' print function is written wrong the line should include Brackets around what should be printed
#File "<stdin>", line 1
#primt 'Hello world!'
#^
#SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#>>>
#THE CORRECT CODE
#print ("Hello world!")
#print ('Hello world!')
#Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?
#b) Main Memory
#Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
#x = 43
#x = x + 1
#print(x)
#b) 44
#Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit,
#(2) Main Memory, (3)Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example,
# “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?
#1-the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit is the brain
#2-the human equivalent to a Main Memory it's the memory of human that include memories that we can't forget
#3-the human equivalent to a Secondary Memory it's the memory of human that include memories that we can forget
#that after some time we forget every thing about it
#4-the human equivalent to a Input Device are ears, eyes, sensing and nose
#5-the human equivalent to a Output Device are mouse, all of our natural behaves
#Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?
#syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python
#sometimes the
#mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the program than where Python
#noticed it was confused
#so I should read this line accurately to find the mistake and re-correct it
